How It Works
Callback Function:
A callback function is a function that is passed to another function as an argument.

It can be done in two ways:

Passing one function as an argument to another function

Calling a function inside another function

In Our Python Program the def function calculate_food_preference calculates the strength of preference based on food's taste, smell, and texture.

The formula assigns weights to each factor (e.g., taste = 50%, smell = 30%, texture = 20%). We can Adjust these weights to reflect your psychological model.

Source: The relative importance of taste, smell, and texture in food preference can really vary among individuals and contexts. A study titled "The relative importance of texture, taste and aroma on a yogurt-type snack food preference in the young and the elderly" in the year 2008 examined how these three specific attributes influence overall taste conditioning of a yogurt-like fermented oat bran product. The findings suggest that while all three factors are significant, their relative importance can differ based on age and individual preferences.

Main Function: food_taste_conditioning validates the callback and executes it with the provided arguments.
Usage:

The User or we can input ratings for taste, smell, and texture (on a scale of 1-10, or any scale you prefer).

The function computes the preference strength based on the callback's logic.

Possible Extensions or additions:
Negative Conditioning: Add parameters like bitterness, unpleasant smell, or adverse texture to reduce the score.
Dynamic Weights: Introduce variables to dynamically adjust the weights based on personal or cultural preferences.
Feedback Loop: Incorporate past experiences with the food to influence future preference scores.
